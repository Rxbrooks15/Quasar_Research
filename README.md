# Quasar_Research
Quasars are characterized by broad spectral lines due to the rapid motion of gas clouds orbiting the center. They manifest their dynamic nature through vigorous outflows powered by the accretion of material and energy. Recent advancements in observational tools, propelled by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), have opened new avenues for quasar analysis, facilitating exploration into their pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies. 

Delving into future implications, AGN feedback will hopefully be studied across millions of galaxies, solidifying the specific mechanisms responsible for energetic large-scale outflows and potentially digging deeper into the positive aspects of AGN feedback based on the compression of gas in the outer regions of a galactic system.
